# Cookie-Deletion-with-Script

In this project we will delete the cookies from our web browser of specific website using Script.
As we move further firstly we have to know that what are cookies?

     Cookies are nothing but a small text files  having special ID tags that stored in web browser. Basically they are created to keep track    of your movements within a site like helps to resume where you left off, storing username and password.
In this project the web browser which we are going to use i.e. Google Chrome version (80.0.3987.163).
To delete the cookies write this script code:

                   main.js
To take the input of a particular site make a web page through HTML
                     
                  index.html

After all this open this html file in the browser and input the site name for which cookies you want to delete.

And now we can see in our browser’s cookie page that particular site’s cookie is deleted or not?
